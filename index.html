                    <p>
                        My name is Rakshita Kumar and I'm a Computer Science student at the University College London.
                        <br><br>

                        Innovation, Coding and Teamwork are three core interlinked elements. I got a chance to experience this when I led a team in a year long project with NHS UK. As a follow up project I developed a Patient Data chatbot which was one of the top 25 submissions at the GOSH FHIRworks hackathon. 
                        <br><br>
                        Inspired by my AI classes, I created a sudoku application and a Movie recommendation website, using Machine Learning concepts.

                        <br><br>
                        Besides my personal projects, my team ventures include an app to support small businesses developed at the American Express Hackathon and a java based program to reconstruct a Computer Shell. I am also co-developing a revision website called "Equical". 
                        <br><br>
                        Outside coding you'll find me playing Badminton and Table Tennis. I also enjoy learning new languages and travelling.

                <h4>Medical Chatbot Hack</h4>
                <p>
                    It is crucial that medical staff have fast access to patient data. This <strong>Python </strong> Project makes patient data retrieval efficient, by developing a Google Assistant Chatbot to access records. The application uses <strong>Google Dialogflow</strong> to extract key information from user input. A response is then computed by querying the <strong>FHIR API</strong>. I individually completed this project in a hackathon and my chatbot was in the top 25 out of 116 submissions. It is now published officially with the Great Ormond Street Hospital.

                    The goal of this <strong>C#</strong> based project was to develop a search system for medical policies in the NHS. An interactive chatbot was designed for the user interface of the search system using the <strong>Azure Bot Framework</strong> and <strong>LUIS</strong>. Additionally to make the search system faster for managing a large database of documents, <strong>Azure Databricks</strong> was utilised. In the end we found that for 88% of sample client queries the system returned the relevant policy in the top 5 results.

                    <p>The goal of this <strong>Python</strong> based project was to develop a system that scans a sudoku puzzle via the webcam and returns the solution to the user. The first step involves extracting the sudoku board from the captured image via <strong>Image Processing</strong>. The numbers on the sudoku board are then recognised by a <strong>Machine Learning</strong> model I trained using the <strong>MNIST dataset</strong>. The sudoku puzzle is then solved via the <strong>backtracking algorithm</strong> and the solving process is visualised using the <strong>pygame</strong> library.

                <h4>Shell Reconstruction
                  </h4>
                <p>

                    The aim of this <strong>Java</strong> based project was to develop a shell similar to the terminal available on computers. To parse in the inputted command the <strong>ANTLR library</strong> was utilised. We then produced a valid output for the inputted user command with the help of the <strong>Visitor, Decorator and Singleton design patterns</strong>. By the end, our shell passed 90.77% of acceptance tests (provided by professor) and supported complex commands such as the pipe operator, command substitution and commands involving regular expressions.

                    I am currently developing a revision management website alongside two other students using <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>. The user inputs topics they have studied throughout the day and the application recommends when to revisit the topic for maximum retention. These results are added automatically to the user’s <strong>Google Calendar</strong>. As Co-Tech lead of the project I had a key role in developing the sign in system. I utilised the <strong>Google Calendar API</strong> and <strong>Firebase</strong> to sign in the user via Gmail and authorise permissions to access the user’s Google Calendar.

              <h4>American Express Hackathon</h4>
              <p>The goal of this <strong>Java</strong> project is to develop a mobile application that connects customers with small businesses so they can complete their list of errands for the day. To determine the best route for the user, the <strong>Google Maps API</strong> was used. Once the itinerary for the day was determined the user can explore reviews of places (developed via the <strong>Yelp API</strong>) and add their experiences of visiting the small businesses to a collection of memories. This app was developed as group project at the American Express Hackathon at UCL.
